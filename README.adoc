= Conjure Sourcery

[quote, Terry Pratchett in Sourcery]
____
As they say in Discworld, we are trying to unravel the Mighty Infinite using a language which was designed to tell one another where the fresh fruit was.

An experimental reimplementation of https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] in Lua via https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel[Fennel]. This is mostly made possible by my precursor project to this one, https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed]. It's a toolkit that aids development of Neovim plugins and configuration through Fennel.

If this experiment is a success it'll eventually replace the main repository as the default Conjure implementation. I'm planning on carrying over a lot of the best behaviors and features while making it smoother, faster and easier to use.
